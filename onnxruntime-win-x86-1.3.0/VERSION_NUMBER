python %~dp0\tools\ci_build\build.py --build_dir %~dp0\build\Windows %*# Building ONNX Runtime
*Dockerfiles are available [here](./dockerfiles) to help you get started.*

*Pre-built packages are available at the locations indicated [here](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime#official-builds).*

## Getting Started: Build the baseline CPU version of ONNX Runtime from source

### Pre-Requisites
* Checkout the source tree:
   ```
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime
   cd onnxruntime
   ```
* Install cmake-3.13 or higher from https://cmake.org/download/.


### Build Instructions
#### Windows
Open Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio version you are going to use. This will properly setup the environment including paths to your compiler, linker, utilities and header files.
```
.\build.bat --config RelWithDebInfo --build_shared_lib --parallel
```
The default Windows CMake Generator is Visual Studio 2017, but you can also use the newer Visual Studio 2019 by passing `--cmake_generator "Visual Studio 16 2019"` to `.\build.bat`


#### Linux/Mac OS X
```
./build.sh --config RelWithDebInfo --build_shared_lib --parallel
```
By default, ORT is configured to be built for a minimum target Mac OS X version of 10.12. 
The shared library in the release Nuget(s) and the Python wheel may be installed on Mac OS X versions of 10.12+. 

#### Notes

* Please note that these instructions build the debug build, which may have performance tradeoffs
* To build the version from each release (which include Windows, Linux, and Mac variants), see these .yml files for reference: [CPU](./tools/ci_build/github/azure-pipelines/nuget/cpu-esrp-pipeline.yml), [GPU](./tools/ci_build/github/azure-pipelines/nuget/gpu-esrp-pipeline.yml)
* The build script runs all unit tests by default (for native builds and skips tests by default for cross-compiled builds).
* If you need to install protobuf 3.6.1 from source code (cmake/external/protobuf), please note:
   * CMake flag protobuf\_BUILD\_SHARED\_LIBS must be turned OFF. After the installation, you should have the 'protoc' executable in your PATH. It is recommended to run `ldconfig` to make sure protobuf libraries are found.
   * If you installed your protobuf in a non standard location it would be helpful to set the following env var:`export CMAKE_ARGS="-DONNX_CUSTOM_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE=full path to protoc"` so the ONNX build can find it. Also run `ldconfig <protobuf lib folder path>` so the linker can find protobuf libraries.
* If you'd like to install onnx from source code (cmake/external/onnx), use:
    ```
    export ONNX_ML=1
    python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
    pip3 install --upgrade dist/*.whl
    ```

## Execution Providers

### CUDA
#### Pre-Requisites
* Install [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
  * ONNX Runtime is built and tested with CUDA 10.0 and cuDNN 7.6 using the Visual Studio 2017 14.11 toolset (i.e. Visual Studio 2017 v15.3). CUDA versions from 9.1 up to 10.1, and cuDNN versions from 7.1 up to 7.4 should also work with Visual Studio 2017.
  * The path to the CUDA installation must be provided via the CUDA_PATH environment variable, or the `--cuda_home parameter`
  * The path to the cuDNN installation (include the `cuda` folder in the path) must be provided via the cuDNN_PATH environment variable, or `--cudnn_home parameter`. The cuDNN path should contain `bin`, `include` and `lib` directories.
  * The path to the cuDNN bin directory must be added to the PATH environment variable so that cudnn64_7.dll is found.

#### Build Instructions
##### Windows

```
.\build.bat --use_cuda --cudnn_home <cudnn home path> --cuda_home <cuda home path>
```

##### Linux
```
./build.sh --use_cuda --cudnn_home <cudnn home path> --cuda_home <cuda home path>
```

A Dockerfile is available [here](./dockerfiles#cuda).


#### Notes
* Depending on compatibility between the CUDA, cuDNN, and Visual Studio 2017 versions you are using, you may need to explicitly install an earlier version of the MSVC toolset.
 * CUDA 10.0 is [known to work](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/cuda-10-is-now-available-with-support-for-the-latest-visual-studio-2017-versions/) with toolsets from 14.11 up to 14.16 (Visual Studio 2017 15.9), and should continue to work with future Visual Studio versions
 * CUDA 9.2 is known to work with the 14.11 MSVC toolset (Visual Studio 15.3 and 15.4)
    * To install the 14.11 MSVC toolset, see [this page](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/11/15/side-by-side-minor-version-msvc-toolsets-in-visual-studio-2017).
    * To use the 14.11 toolset with a later version of Visual Studio 2017 you have two options:
     1. Setup the Visual Studio environment variables to point to the 14.11 toolset by running vcvarsall.bat, prior to running the build script. e.g. if you have VS2017 Enterprise, an x64 build would use the following command `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64 -vcvars_ver=14.11` For convenience, .\build.amd64.1411.bat will do this and can be used in the same way as .\build.bat. e.g. ` .\build.amd64.1411.bat --use_cuda`

     2. Alternatively, if you have CMake 3.13 or later you can specify the toolset version via the `--msvc_toolset` build script parameter. e.g. `.\build.bat --msvc_toolset 14.11`

* If you have multiple versions of CUDA installed on a Windows machine and are building with Visual Studio, CMake will use the build files for the highest version of CUDA it finds in the BuildCustomization folder.
e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\VC\VCTargets\BuildCustomizations\.
If you want to build with an earlier version, you must temporarily remove the 'CUDA x.y.*' files for later versions from this directory.

### Android NNAPI

See more information on the NNAPI Execution Provider [here](./docs/execution_providers/NNAPI-ExecutionProvider.md).

#### Pre-Requisites

To build ONNX Runtime with the NN API EP, first install Android NDK (see [Android Build instructions](#android))

#### Build Instructions

The basic build commands are below. There are also some other parameters for building the Android version. See [Android Build instructions](#android) for more details.

##### Cross compiling on Windows

```bash
./build.bat --android --android_sdk_path <android sdk path> --android_ndk_path <android ndk path> --dnnlibrary
```

##### Cross compiling on Linux

### NUPHAR
See more information on the Nuphar Execution Provider [here](./docs/execution_providers/Nuphar-ExecutionProvider.md).

#### Pre-Requisites
* The Nuphar execution provider for ONNX Runtime is built and tested with LLVM 9.0.0. Because of TVM's requirement when building with LLVM, you need to build LLVM from source. To build the debug flavor of ONNX Runtime, you need the debug build of LLVM.
   * Windows (Visual Studio 2017):
   ```
   REM download llvm source code 9.0.0 and unzip to \llvm\source\path, then install to \llvm\install\path
   cd \llvm\source\path
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86 -DLLVM_ENABLE_DIA_SDK=OFF
   msbuild llvm.sln /maxcpucount /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\llvm\install\path -DBUILD_TYPE=Release -P cmake_install.cmake
   ```

*Note that following LLVM cmake patch is necessary to make the build work on Windows, Linux does not need to apply the patch.*

```
source /opt/fsl-imx-xwayland/4.*/environment-setup-aarch64-poky-linux
alias cmake="/usr/bin/cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$OECORE_NATIVE_SYSROOT/usr/share/cmake/OEToolchainConfig.cmake"
```
* See [Build ARM](#ARM) below for information on building for ARM devices

#### Build Instructions

1. Configure ONNX Runtime with ACL support:
```
cmake ../onnxruntime-arm-upstream/cmake -DONNX_CUSTOM_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/protoc -Donnxruntime_RUN_ONNX_TESTS=OFF -Donnxruntime_GENERATE_TEST_REPORTS=ON -Donnxruntime_DEV_MODE=ON -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 -Donnxruntime_USE_CUDA=OFF -Donnxruntime_USE_NSYNC=OFF -Donnxruntime_CUDNN_HOME= -Donnxruntime_USE_JEMALLOC=OFF -Donnxruntime_ENABLE_PYTHON=OFF -Donnxruntime_BUILD_CSHARP=OFF -Donnxruntime_BUILD_SHARED_LIB=ON -Donnxruntime_USE_EIGEN_FOR_BLAS=ON -Donnxruntime_USE_OPENBLAS=OFF -Donnxruntime_USE_ACL=ON -Donnxruntime_USE_DNNL=OFF -Donnxruntime_USE_MKLML=OFF -Donnxruntime_USE_OPENMP=ON -Donnxruntime_USE_TVM=OFF -Donnxruntime_USE_LLVM=OFF -Donnxruntime_ENABLE_MICROSOFT_INTERNAL=OFF -Donnxruntime_USE_BRAINSLICE=OFF -Donnxruntime_USE_NUPHAR=OFF -Donnxruntime_USE_EIGEN_THREADPOOL=OFF -Donnxruntime_BUILD_UNIT_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
```
The ```-Donnxruntime_USE_ACL=ON``` option will use, by default, the 19.05 version of the Arm Compute Library. To set the right version you can use:
```-Donnxruntime_USE_ACL_1902=ON```, ```-Donnxruntime_USE_ACL_1905=ON``` or ```-Donnxruntime_USE_ACL_1908=ON```;

2. Build ONNX Runtime library, test and performance application:
```
make -j 6
```

3. Deploy ONNX runtime on the i.MX 8QM board
```
libonnxruntime.so.0.5.0
onnxruntime_perf_test
onnxruntime_test_all
```

* add --x86 argument to build.sh

---

### ARM
We have experimental support for Linux ARM builds. Windows on ARM is well tested.

#### Cross compiling for ARM with Docker (Linux/Windows - FASTER, RECOMMENDED)
This method allows you to compile using a desktop or cloud VM. This is much faster than compiling natively and avoids out-of-memory issues that may be encountered when on lower-powered ARM devices. The resulting ONNX Runtime Python wheel (.whl) file is then deployed to an ARM device where it can be invoked in Python 3 scripts.

See the instructions for the the Dockerfile [here](./dockerfiles/README.md#arm-32v7).

#### Cross compiling on Linux (without Docker)
1. Get the corresponding toolchain. For example, if your device is Raspberry Pi and the device os is Ubuntu 16.04, you may use gcc-linaro-6.3.1 from [https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries)
2. Setup env vars
    ```bash
       export PATH=/opt/gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.05-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf/bin:$PATH
       export CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc
       export CXX=arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++
    ```
3. Get a pre-compiled protoc:

   You may get it from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.11.2/protoc-3.11.2-linux-x86_64.zip . Please unzip it after downloading.
4. (optional) Setup sysroot for enabling python extension. (TODO: will add details later)
5. Save the following content as tool.cmake
    ```
    set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
    set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER arm-linux-gnueabihf-c++)
    set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc)
    set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
    set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
    set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
    set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE ONLY)
    ```
6. Append `-DONNX_CUSTOM_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/protoc -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/tool.cmake` to your cmake args, run cmake and make to build it.

#### Native compiling on Linux ARM device (SLOWER)
Docker build runs on a Raspberry Pi 3B with Raspbian Stretch Lite OS (Desktop version will run out memory when linking the .so file) will take 8-9 hours in total.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    sudo \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    libcurl4-openssl-dev \
    libssl-dev \
    wget \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    python3-dev \
    git \
    tar

pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
pip3 install --upgrade wheel
pip3 install numpy

# Build the latest cmake
mkdir /code
cd /code
wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.13/cmake-3.13.5.tar.gz;
tar zxf cmake-3.13.5.tar.gz

cd /code/cmake-3.13.5
./configure --system-curl
make
sudo make install

# Prepare onnxruntime Repo
cd /code
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime

# Start the basic build
cd /code/onnxruntime
./build.sh --config MinSizeRel --update --build

# Build Shared Library
./build.sh --config MinSizeRel --build_shared_lib

# Build Python Bindings and Wheel
./build.sh --config MinSizeRel --enable_pybind --build_wheel

# Build Output
ls -l /code/onnxruntime/build/Linux/MinSizeRel/*.so
ls -l /code/onnxruntime/build/Linux/MinSizeRel/dist/*.whl
```

#### Cross compiling on Windows
**Using Visual C++ compilers**
1. Download and install Visual C++ compilers and libraries for ARM(64).
   If you have Visual Studio installed, please use the Visual Studio Installer (look under the section `Individual components` after choosing to `modify` Visual Studio) to download and install the corresponding ARM(64) compilers and libraries.

2. Use `.\build.bat` and specify `--arm` or `--arm64` as the build option to start building. Preferably use `Developer Command Prompt for VS` or make sure all the installed cross-compilers are findable from the command prompt being used to build using the PATH environmant variable.

---

### Android

#### Pre-Requisites

Install Android NDK in Android Studio or https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads

#### Build Instructions

##### Cross compiling on Windows

```bash
./build.bat --android --android_sdk_path <android sdk path> --android_ndk_path <android ndk path> --android_abi <android abi, e.g., arm64-v8a (default) or armeabi-v7a> --android_api <android api level, e.g., 27 (default)>
```

##### Cross compiling on Linux

```bash
./build.sh --android --android_sdk_path <android sdk path> --android_ndk_path <android ndk path> --android_abi <android abi, e.g., arm64-v8a (default) or armeabi-v7a> --android_api <android api level, e.g., 27 (default)>
```

Android Archive (AAR) files, which can be imported directly in Android Studio, will be generated in your_build_dir/java/build/outputs/aar.

If you want to use NNAPI Execution Provider on Android, see [docs/execution_providers/NNAPI-ExecutionProvider.md](/docs/execution_providers/NNAPI-ExecutionProvider.md).

# Contributing

We're always looking for your help to fix bugs and improve the product. Create a pull request and we'll be happy to take a look.
Start by reading the [Engineering Design](docs/HighLevelDesign.md). You can find the doxygen generated documentation [here](https://microsoft.github.io/onnxruntime/).

## Proposing new public APIs

 ONNX Runtime has a collection of [public APIs](docs/HighLevelDesign.md).  Some of these APIs make their way back into the Windows OS.  We make compatibility committments for these APIs and follow a structured process when adding to them.  Please use the [Feature Request issue template](issues/new?template=feature_request.md) before starting any PRs that affect any of the public APIs.

## Process details

Please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues) for a similar idea first: there may already be an issue you can contribute to.

1. **Create Issue**  
To propose a new feature or API please start by filing a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues).  
Include as much detail as you have. It's fine if it's not a complete design: just a summary and rationale is a good starting point.

2. **Discussion**  
We'll keep the issue open for community discussion until it has been resolved or is deemed no longer relevant.
Note that if an issue isn't a high priority or has many open questions then it might stay open for a long time.

3. **Owner Review**  
The ONNX Runtime team will review the proposal and either approve or close the issue based on whether it broadly aligns with the [Onnx Runtime Roadmap - High Level Goals section](../docs/Roadmap.md) and contribution guidelines.

4. **API Review**  
If the feature adds new APIs then we'll start an API review.
All new public APIs must be reviewed before merging.  
For making changes to the C API refer to guidance [here](onnxruntime/core/session/onnxruntime_c_api.cc#L1326).
For making changes to the WinRT API someone from the ONNX Runtime team will workwith you.

1. **Implementation**
* A feature can be implemented by you, the ONNX Runtime team, or other community members.  Code contributions are greatly appreciated: feel free to work on any reviewed feature you proposed, or choose one in the backlog and send us a PR. If you are new to the project and want to work on an existing issue, we recommend starting with issues that are tagged with “good first issue”. Please let us know in the issue comments if you are actively working on implementing a feature so we can ensure it's assigned to you.  
* Unit tests: New code *must* be accompanied by unit tests.
* Documentation and sample updates: If the PR affects any of the documentation or samples then include those updates in the same PR.
* Build instructions are [here](BUILD.md).
* Checkin Procedure:  Once a feature is complete and tested according to the contribution guidelines follow these steps:
   * Fork the repo
   * git clone your fork
   * Create feature branch
   * Make and checkin your changes along with unit tests
   * git commit your changes
   * git push origin HEAD
   * To request merge into master, send a pull request from the [web ui](https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime).
  * Add 'Microsoft/onnxruntime' as a reviewer.
* Binaries: We periodically produce signed prerelease binaries from the master branch to validate new features and APIs.  After the feature has been sufficiently validated as part of a prerelease package we will include it in the next stable binary release.
* Note: After creating a pull request, you might not see a build getting triggered right away. One of the
onnxruntime team members will trigger the build for you.

**ONNX Runtime** is a performance-focused inference engine for ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) models.

Models in the Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, scikit-learn, CoreML, and other popular [supported formats](https://github.com/onnx/tutorials#converting-to-onnx-format) can be converted to the standard [ONNX](https://onnx.ai) format, providing framework interoperability and helping to maximize the reach of hardware optimization investments. This provides a solution for systems to integrate a single inference engine to support models trained from a variety of frameworks, while taking advantage of specific hardware accelerators where available.

ONNX Runtime was designed with a focus on performance and scalability in order to support heavy workloads in high-scale production scenarios. It also has extensibility options for compatibility with emerging hardware developments.

ONNX Runtime stays up to date with the ONNX standard and supports all operators from the ONNX v1.2+ spec and is backwards compatible with older versions. Please refer to [this page](docs/Versioning.md) for ONNX opset compatibility details.

# Functional Overview
## Key Features
* **Cross Platform:** The runtime provides a cross platform API compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac and a variety of architectures. Both CPU and GPUs are supported, and language bindings are available for a variety of languages and architectures See more details ([below](apis-and-official-builds)). *If you have specific scenarios that are not supported, please share your suggestions and scenario details via [Github Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues).*
* **Run any ONNX model:** ONNX Runtime provides comprehensive support of the ONNX spec and can be used to run all models based on ONNX v1.2.1 and higher. Both ONNX (DNN) and ONNX-ML (traditional ML) operator sets are supported. *The full set of operators and types supported is listed [here](./docs/OperatorKernels.md). Some operators not supported in the current ONNX version may be available as a [Contrib Operator](./docs/ContribOperators.md).*
* **Backwards Compatible**: Newer versions of ONNX Runtime support all models that worked with prior versions, so updates should not break integrations. *See version compatibility details [here](./docs/Versioning.md).*

## Builds and Packages

Official builds are available for:
* Default CPU Provider (Eigen + MLAS)
* GPU Provider - NVIDIA CUDA
  * *note: If your deployment target is Windows, the [DirectML execution provider](./docs/execution_providers/DirectML-ExecutionProvider.md) is recommended for optimal performance and compatibility with a broad set of GPUs. This will be an official package soon. In the meantime, see the build instructions at [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md#directml).* 

Python packages can be found on PyPi, and C#/C/C++ packages on Nuget. Please view the table on [aka.ms/onnxruntime](https://aka.ms/onnxruntime) for instructions for different build combinations. 

For additional build flavors and/or dockerfiles, please carefully read through [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md). If you encounter problems, please provide as much information as possible when filing an [issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime/issues). 

For production scenarios, it's strongly recommended to build only from an [official release branch](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases).

#### PyPi (Python):
*If using `pip` to download the Python binaries, run `pip install --upgrade pip` prior to downloading.*

* [onnxruntime](https://pypi.org/project/onnxruntime)
* [onnxruntime-gpu](https://pypi.org/project/onnxruntime-gpu)

#### Nuget (C#/C/C++):
* [Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime)
* [Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Gpu](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.gpu)

#### Other package repositories:
Contributed non-official packages (including Homebrew, Linuxbrew, and nixpkgs) are listed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/windows-ml/get-started-uwp). These are not maintained by the core ONNX Runtime team and will have limited support; use at your discretion.

### System Requirements
These system requirements must be met for using the compiled binaries. 

#### System language
* Installation of the **English language package** and configuring `en_US.UTF-8 locale` is required, as certain operators makes use of system locales. 
* For Ubuntu, install [language-pack-en package](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=language-pack-en)
  * Run the following commands:
    `locale-gen en_US.UTF-8`
    `update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
  * Follow similar procedure to configure other locales on other platforms.
  
#### Default CPU
* ONNX Runtime binaries in the CPU packages use OpenMP and depend on the library being available at runtime in the
system.
  * For Windows, **OpenMP** support comes as part of VC runtime. It is also available as redist packages:
    [vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) and [vc_redist.x86.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
  * For Linux, the system must have **libgomp.so.1** which can be installed using `apt-get install libgomp1`.

#### Default GPU (CUDA)
* The default GPU build requires CUDA runtime libraries being installed on the system:
	 * Version: **CUDA 10.1** and **cuDNN 7.6.5**
* Version dependencies from older ONNX Runtime releases can be found in [prior release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases).

#### Other Execution Providers
* For requirements and dependencies of other build options, see detailed build instructions on the [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md#additional-build-instructions) page.

# Usage
## [Samples and Tutorials](./samples)

## [Frequently Asked Questions](./docs/FAQ.md)

## Getting ONNX Models
To get an ONNX model, please view these [ONNX Tutorials](https://github.com/onnx/tutorials#getting-onnx-models).
ONNX Runtime supports all versions of ONNX 1.2+. Full versioning compatibility information can be found under [Versioning](docs/Versioning.md#tool-compatibility).

## Deploying ONNX Runtime
### Cloud
ONNX Runtime can be deployed to the cloud for model inferencing using [Azure Machine Learning Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-service). See [detailed instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-build-deploy-onnx) and [sample notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/deployment/onnx).

**ONNX Runtime Server (beta)** is a hosted application for serving ONNX models using ONNX Runtime, providing a REST API for prediction. Usage details can be found [here](./docs/ONNX_Runtime_Server_Usage.md), and image installation instructions are [here](./dockerfiles#onnx-runtime-server-preview).

### IoT and edge devices
The expanding focus and selection of IoT devices with sensors and consistent signal streams introduces new opportunities to move AI workloads to the edge.
 
This is particularly important when there are massive volumes of incoming data/signals that may not be efficient or useful to push to the cloud due to storage or latency considerations. Consider: surveillance tapes where 99% of footage is uneventful, or real-time person detection scenarios where immediate action is required. In these scenarios, directly executing model inferencing on the target device is crucial for optimal assistance.
 
To deploy AI workloads to these edge devices and take advantage of hardware acceleration capabilities on the target device, see [these reference implementations](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/onnxruntime-iot-edge).

### Client applications
Install or build the package you need to use in your application. Check [this page](https://microsoft.github.io/onnxruntime/) for installation/package guidance. See [sample implementations](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/master/samples/c_cxx) using the C++ API. 

On newer Windows 10 devices (1809+), ONNX Runtime is available by default as part of the OS and is accessible via the [Windows Machine Learning APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/windows-ml/). Find tutorials [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/windows-ml/get-started-desktop) for building a Windows Desktop or UWP application using WinML.

2. License Grants and Conditions

--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities

-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                        https://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
